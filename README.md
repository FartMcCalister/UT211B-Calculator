# UT211B-Calculator

This is a modification of Alderweb's excellent [Uni-T UT210E EEPROM configuration tool](https://github.com/adlerweb/UT210E-Calculator). This version works with the UT211B multimeter.

You can download HTML file and run it locally or go [here](https://fartmccalister.github.io/UT211B-Calculator) to run it in your browser without downloading anything.
